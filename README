AWNotification is a simple class to show non-interactive pop-up views. This is useful e.g. if you're performing a long-running task that the user cares about.

TO GET STARTED IN YOUR PROJECT:
Add
	- AWNotification.m
	- AWNotification.h
	- x.png
	- check.png

I've provided a pretty simple app highlighting how to use the notification class. But briefly, here's how it works:

	// 1
	AWNotification *notification = [[AWNotification alloc] initWithNotificationStyle:AWNotificationStyleRoundedRect];
	
	// 2
	notification.message = @"Trying very hard...";
	
	//3
	[notification show];
	
Pretty straight-forward, eh?
You'll want to hold onto the AWNotification instance as an ivar or a property, so you can modify and/or hide it later. 
To change the displayed text, just alter the message property:

	notification.message = @"Almost done...";
	
And then, once whatever task you've been doing is done, you can close the notification with one of three calls:

	if (success)
		[notification hideWithSuccessMessage:@"We did it!"];
		
	else if (failure)
		[notification hideWithFailureMessage:@"Sorry, didn't work."];
		
	else
		[notification hideWithMessage:@"Age of Aquarius"]

 	[notification release];
	
I think that's it for now...
