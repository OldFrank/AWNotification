AWNotification is a simple class to show non-interactive pop-up views. This is useful e.g. if you're performing a long-running task that the user cares about.

TO GET STARTED IN YOUR PROJECT:
Add
	- AWNotification.m
	- AWNotification.h
	- x.png
	- check.png

I've provided a pretty simple app highlighting how to use the notification class. But briefly, here's how it works:

	// Start some long-running process you want the user to know about...

	AWNotification *notification = [[AWNotification alloc] initWithNotificationStyle:AWNotificationStylePill];
	notification.message = @"Getting to work...";
	notification.center = CGPointMake(160.0, 400.0); // optionally move the notification view around
	[notification show];
	
	// ... the status of the process changes
	notification.message = @"Almost finished..."
	
	// ... and then, finally, you're done
	
	if (success)
		[notification hideWithSuccessMessage:@"We did it!"];
		
	else if (failure)
		[notification hideWithFailureMessage:@"Sorry, didn't work."];
		
	else
		[notification hideWithMessage:@"Age of Aquarius"]

 	[notification release];

Pretty straight-forward, eh?

There are three notification styles:
- AWNotificationStyleRoundedRect (think of the Twitter app, formerly Tweetie 2, when publishing to Instapaper)
- AWNotificationStylePill (thin rounded rectangle)
- AWNotificationStyleFullScreen 

Also, you can modify the center of the notification view to move it around.
